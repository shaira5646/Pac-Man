# Pac-Man-
A computer graphics project 'PAC-Man' made in python

We created a layout with the Pacman, such as the one in the Pac-Man game. The objective for the Pacman would be to move towards the points/food. There would be obstacles (i.e. monsters and walls) along the way. Along with obtaining points, the Pacman should be able to avoid the monsters to finish the game. Our primary focus was to create level 1 of the game only. To make the project interactive, we would allow the user to control Pac-Manâ€™s movement and direction.

We used GL lines to create the maze, 8-way symmetry, and GL triangles to create the Pacman, GL triangles and quad for ghosts and lives count, midpoint circle algorithm for the fruits, and the midpoint line algorithm for the score. Transformations like, reflection, rotation, and translation were used to make several copies of the same shape. This is the default layout.
